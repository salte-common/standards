# Remote Standards Preflight

- Remote standards repo: https://github.com/salte-common/standards
- Before any changes, recursively read all standards in the remote repo.
- Determine applicable standards based on the application type.
- If local standards exist, they override remote standards.
- Validate all output against the applicable standards.
- If remote access is unavailable, state it and request a local copy or snapshot.
