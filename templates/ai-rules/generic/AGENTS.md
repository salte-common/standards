Remote standards repository:
https://github.com/salte-common/standards

Preflight requirements:
1. Recursively read all standards documents in the remote repository.
2. Determine which standards apply based on the application type.
3. If local standards exist, they override remote standards.
4. Validate all work against the applicable standards.

If remote access is unavailable, state it and request a local copy or snapshot.
